AI Network Optimizer
====================

An intelligent network optimization platform that leverages advanced AI algorithms to enhance network performance, security, and efficiency.

# What is AI Network Optimizer

AI Network Optimizer is a cutting-edge solution that combines artificial intelligence with network management to provide intelligent routing, automated security, and performance optimization for modern network infrastructures. Built on a robust foundation of proven networking technologies, it delivers enterprise-grade network optimization with AI-driven insights.

Key features include intelligent traffic routing, automated threat detection, performance monitoring, and predictive network analytics.

# About this repository

AI Network Optimizer is built on a sophisticated architecture that combines multiple specialized components. The system leverages a modular approach where each component is optimized for specific network functions.

Some components are enhanced versions of proven networking technologies, while others are custom-developed AI modules created specifically for intelligent network optimization. Each module is maintained in its own repository, allowing for independent development and testing.

This repository serves as the central hub that orchestrates the build process, manages dependencies between components, and provides the tools necessary to create optimized network images with integrated AI capabilities.

# Repository Structure

The AI Network Optimizer repository is organized into several key directories:

 * `build/`    Contains temporary build files and generated artifacts
 * `data/`     Configuration data and templates for network optimization modules
 * `packages/` Houses specialized network packages including AI-enhanced routing,
               security modules, and performance optimization components
 * `scripts/`  Build automation scripts and deployment tools
 * `tools/`    Development utilities and maintenance automation scripts

# Building AI Network Optimizer

To build the AI Network Optimizer system, you can use either Docker containers for a consistent build environment or build natively on supported systems. The build process creates optimized network images with integrated AI capabilities.

For detailed build instructions, please refer to our comprehensive build documentation.

# Development Branches

The default branch that contains the most recent AI Network Optimizer code is called `current`.
We may or may not eventually switch to `main`.

All new AI enhancements and network optimizations go to the `current` branch. When a new stable release is ready for feature freeze, a
new branch is created for the release, and new features from `current` are backported
to the release branch as needed.

Post-1.2.0 branches are named after constellations sorted by area from smallest
to largest. There are 88 of them, here's the
[complete list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_designated_constellations_by_area).

Existing branches:

* AI Network Optimizer 1.4: `sagitta` (Arrow) [LTS]
* AI Network Optimizer 1.3: `equuleus` (Little Horse) [LTS]
* AI Network Optimizer 1.2: `crux` (Southern Cross) [Unsupported]

The next LTS release will be AI Network Optimizer 1.5 `circinus` (Compasses).
